# vanilla javascript games
each folder contains html/css/js files that together make up a simple game i made this summer while learning vanilla javascript from scratch. each folder contains one individual project (like hangman, tic tac toe etc.) and each project folder has it's own readme with an explanation, a working demo link and/or a screenshot of the website or the output screen that's supposed to be viewable to the user.
