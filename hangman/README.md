# hangman (html/scss/js)
this is a simple hangman game made using html, css and vanilla javascript. the user starts off with 10 lives and loses one life everytime they guess wrong and press a letter that is not a part of the selected word (that is a part of a pre-existing list) set by me. each right entry fills up the previously blank spots and each wrong entry causes the character to lose one more limb (aka more limbs are hanged one by one) till they're either completely hanged or the word has been guessed. the goal is to guess the word before the lives are over and the character is fully hanged (with or without asking for an additional clue).
